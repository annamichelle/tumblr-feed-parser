## Tumblr feed parser

*Simple JSON feed parser for Tumblr blogs.*

- Styled with [Twitter Bootstrap](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
- Using [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com) to format the date.
- Using [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for post type icons.

### HOW TO:

1. Edit ``var blog_name `` with ``YOURBLOGNAME`` in ``tumblr-parser.js``. If your blog address is 'http://nyancat.tumblr.com/', your blog name is "nyancat".

To turn it into the ultimate social aggregator feed, create some recipes with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and automatically post anything you want to your Tumblr:

- Dropbox to Tumblr [recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/90662)
- Evernote to Tumblr [recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/90663)
- Create RSS recipes to publish your RSS feed (Twitter and Github?).
- For Spotify tracks, checkout the "sharing" options within the Spotify app [support link](http://support.spotify.com/us/learn-more/guides/#!/article/Sharing-music).
- For the markdown junkies: [Markable](http://markable.in/).

### WHAT?

It's just a feed. You can see a working example on [www.jeremymouton.com](http://www.jeremymouton.com/).

### TODO:
- Code syntax hightlighting for Github Gists.
- Add "Chat" post option.
