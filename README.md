## Tumblr feed parser

*Simple JSON feed parser for Tumblr blogs.*

Working example: [www.jeremymouton.com](http://www.jeremymouton.com/)

- Styled with [Twitter Bootstrap](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).
- Using [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com) to format the date.
- Using [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) for post type icons.

### HOW TO:

To pull in another feed edit ````var blog_url ```` with ````http://YOURBLOG.tumblr.com````.

Use this script on your own page and feed it using recipes from [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/):

- Dropbox to Tumblr [recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/90662)
- Evernote to Tumblr [recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/90663)
- Create an RSS recipe to publish your Twitter and Github feeds to Tumblr.
- To publish Spotify tracks, checkout the Sharing options within the Spotify app, you can post audio tracks to Tumblr (much better than Last.fm integration).

### TODO:
- Code syntax hightlighting for Github Gists.
